/**
 * Indicates that annotated interface is a "Row Level Role". Row level role is a container that holds row-level policies.
 * <p>
 * Row-level policies restrict which data should be return to the user (e.g. a user should only see contracts created by
 * user's department) or which data the user can create, update or delete.
 * <p>
 * Annotated interfaces are parsed by the {@link AnnotatedResourceRoleProvider} and {@link
 * io.jmix.security.model.RowLevelRole} objects are created using the information from the annotated interface.
 * <p>
 * Role definition example:
 * <pre>
 * &#064;RowLevelRole(code = "orderView", name = "Order view")
 * public interface OrderViewRole {
 *
 *     &#064;JpqlRowLevelPolicy(entityClass = TestOrder.class,
 *             join = "join e.customer c",
 *             where = "c.status = 'active'")
 *     void order();
 *
 *     &#064;PredicateRowLevelPolicy(entityClass = Order.class,
 *         actions = {RowLevelPolicyAction.READ})
 *     static Predicate<Order> readZeroOrdersOnly() {
 *         return order -> order.getNumber().startsWith("0");
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Role interface may have any number of methods. Methods can have any names, methods are used only to group policies
 * logically. Policies may be grouped by entity they relate (as in the example above) or by type (one method will have
 * annotations for screen policies, another one for entity policies, etc.).
 * <p>
 * Method return type matters only for methods with {@link PredicateRowLevelPolicy} annotations.
